# Introduction

Welcome to Botmock API (early preview). You can use our API to access your Botmock projects and get details like messages payload, boards etc.

Please note that this *early preview* of our API. In coming months we will be updating our API to provide more robust information. For specific requests please email at [support@botmock.com](mailto:support@botmock.com).

## API Endpoint

All API requests should be sent to https://app.botmock.com/api

# Overview

In Botmock everyone must belong to a team. Each team can have multiple projects under it and each project can be of one of two types:

- Conversation **Flow**
- Conversation **Mock**

## Conversation Flows

As the name suggests, conversation flows represent an entire conversation tree where each node can have multiple outgoing connections. Each node is called a **message**. Messages can be of different types. See [message types](#message-types) for more details.

## Conversation Mocks

Another way to visualize a single conversation path is to build a conversation mock. This type of project has multiple __boards__ that represent a conversation screen based on the [project type](#project-types). In a mock project, a user can create multiple boards but each board can only have one chain of linked messages. In other words, each message can only have *one* previous and *one* next possible message.

## Project Types

We have to different kinds of projects in Botmock.

### Conversation Flow 
Conversation flows are tree like structures which enable to you map out the entire conversations. This is a great way to map out how your user journey would look like within your bot. We recommend you to create the conversation flow around a specific user story. You can always extract specific paths as conversation mocks.

### Conversation Mock
Conversation mocks are simply a single conversation layout. They are great if you want to quickly visualize a single conversation path and perhaps create variations for it. In a conversation mock project you are able to create multiple boards. Each board represents a single chat window.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://app.botmock.com/api/teams"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-API-TOKEN"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR-API-TOKEN` with your API token.

Botmock uses API tokens to grant access to the API.  You can register a new Botmock API token at our [account settings](https://app.botmock.com/settings#/api). Please note that tokens are only shown once and are as important as your account login details.

Botmock expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR-API-TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOUR-API-TOKEN</code> with your personal API token.

This endpoint retrieves a specific board that you requests. Each board contains a `root_messages` property that is an array of `message ids` that act as a starting point (i.e. they have no connections coming into them) and a `messages` property that is an `Array` of `messages` that have the following attributes:

Attribute  |  Type  |  Description
----------  | ---------------- | -------------
message_id | string | a unique id that represents this message
message_type | string | type of message (see [Message Types](#message-types) for details)
next_message_ids | array | an array representing a list of possible messages that you can go to from here
previous_message_ids | array | an array representing a list of possible messages that lead to this message
is_root | boolean | a boolean is this a root message
payload | object | a data structure that represents the JSON representation of what the message looks like. *NOTE* this might not be a complete payload that you can send to the platform. 

### HTTP Request

`GET https://app.botmock.com/api/teams/<TEAM-ID>/projects/<PROJECT-ID>/boards/<BOARD-ID>`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
TEAM-ID | The ID of the team to retrieve
PROJECT-ID | The ID of the project you want to retreive
BOARD-ID | The ID of the specific board you want to retreive

## Platform Payloads (Coming Soon)

In near future we will be giving you access to get platform ready JSON payload for any given message within the board. 

# Wrappers

We're actively working on creating wrappers that will make interacting with our API a breeze.
